NAME
  RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips

DESCRIPTION
  This is a fork of RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips by Torsten
  Brumm, the original github repository is available here:
  https://github.com/tbrumm/RT-Extension-QueueDeactivatedScrips

  The forked version, making it compatible with RT 4.0.4 is here:
  https://github.com/dmsimard/RT-Extension-QueueDeactivatedScrips  

  If you have a large amount of Queues and you don't like to manage
  all scrips per queue by hand, this extension offers a way to
  create global scrips and enable and disable them on a queue level.

  Extended files include:
  - html/Admin/Queues/Scrips.html
  - html/Admin/Elements/EditScrips
  - lib/RT/Scrip.pm

INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)
  
  4. Run "make initdb" for first time installation

  5. Add "RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.

TROUBLESHOOTING
  * The activation toggle configuration appears in both Global and Queue
  scrip configuration but it doesn't seem to do anything.

    Enable debug logging in your RT_SiteConfig.pm, restart your webserver
    and do an action that would trigger a global scrip.
    Look through your debug logs and try to find something like the
    following:
      Scrip XX has been applied, since it is not deactivated for Queue YYY
      Scrip XX has NOT been applied, since it is deactivated for Queue YYY

    If you don't see something like this at all, try copying
    local/plugins/RT-Extension-QueueDeactivatedScrips/lib/RT/Scrip.pm to
    local/lib/RT/Scrip.pm

    and try again.

TODO
  EditScrips inside RT 3.8.x works different like older versions,
  we have replaced the file with an older version, this runs fine
  so far, but i like to have all clean. Patches are welcome.
