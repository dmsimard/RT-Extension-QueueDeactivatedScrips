NAME
  RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips

DESCRIPTION
  If you work a lot with ticket links, it is hard to keep an overview
  of all tickets and related ticket status. Normally you have to open
  each ticket to see the status/owner, with this RT-Extension you can
  see all your tickets (from a search) with their related tickets

INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)
  
  4. Run "make initdb" for first time installation

  5. Additionally, if you're running 3.8, you'll need to add
     "RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.
